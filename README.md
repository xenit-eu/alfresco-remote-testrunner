Run your Alfresco JUnit integration tests with standard JUnit test tooling.

The Alfresco Remote Testrunner is a JUnit runner that forwards tests to a running Alfresco Repository and reports the results back.

The Alfresco Remote Testrunner and your integration tests are packaged in [Dynamic Extensions](https://github.com/xenit-eu/dynamic-extensions-for-alfresco) bundles, so they can be installed in a running Alfresco Repository without installing an AMP.
